# What is BookClurb?

Right now, BookClurb is a set of open-source tools that make it easier to administer a book club. Keeping a book club going is hard work. It requires consistently doing the reading, figuring out a time to meet, selecting the next book in a way that is fair, and dealing with the myriad issues that arise in long term relationships. While this work is rewarding, book club administrators can benefit from a set of tools that are specially made to help them with their task. In addition, these tools have the potential to introduce new rituals to the book club (such as rating books on close-out and new book selection processes) that deepen the experience.

## Where is BookClurb going?

BookClurb aims deepen the experience of book club. An entrypoint to this is building tools that support the book club admin, but there are other ways to achieve this goal:

1. **Connecting book clubs with authors.** How cool would it be to talk with the author of the book you just read? On the flip side, I believe that there are many talented writers out there that are searching for their readers. Clubs will develop their own personalities, and authors may find it rewarding to discuss with a group of people that form that personality, as opposed to an individual.

2. **Connecting book clubs with each other.** It may be rewarding for a book club to learn about the personality of another book club. For example, what another club thought about the same book. This could unite people across clubs under the shared interest of reading and learning.

3. **Facilitating in-person book club meetups.** There are special requirements for book club meetups, for example, space for the entire book club, and a private area where the club can discuss. These are not always easy to find in a place that all club members can get to. BookClurb may be able to develop relationships with venues that are good at hosting book clubs and make these easily accessible to clubs.

## Why open-source?

It is important that this project remains open-source (repository [here](https://github.com/dhvogel/bookclurb)). Of course, it gives me internet cred. But more importantly, it allows anyone to contribute back the rituals of their book club. I can only develop for the rituals of my book club, and maybe a couple friends. But by opening this up to the internet community, any club can contribute theirs.
