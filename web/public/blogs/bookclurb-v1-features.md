# BookClurb v1 Features & Feedback

## What's Included in v1

v1 is geared toward the *book club admin*. In the future, our plan is to make something that engages the whole book club. For now, the focus is just providing a set of tools to the book club admin to make their job easier. For example, using bookclurb instead of a home-cooked spreadsheet to track everything.

## What's Next?

We want to understand the pain points of managing a book club first, anything that makes the book club admin's job easier. It could be reading in data from a spreadsheet, exporting data, figuring out the right onboarding flow.

Then, make the site more enjoyable for the average book club member. This might take some more social features, such as a discussion board with emoji reactions, some new rituals, such as an end-of-book quiz, or features that introduce clubs to one another.

In the future, we want to make it easier for book clubs to connect with the authors that they are reading. There are many talented authors out there that are looking for the readers. From the book clubs perspective, we believe that people want to read things that are real, from people who are real. Especially in this era of all this AI-garbage writing. Reading something that is clearly written by another human is refreshing. Connecting with other people is refreshing. And this project enables both.

Your feedback helps us prioritize what to build next. Thank you for being part of the BookClurb community!
