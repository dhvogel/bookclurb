# BookClurb v1 Features & Feedback

## What's Included in v1

v1 is geared toward the *book club admin*. There are challenges with being the admin. It requires managing the meeting schedule, selecting the next book in a way that is fair, communicating readings to members, and all of the other give and take that comes with leading a group.

## We Want Your Feedback!

Right now, the most important thing for us is to get feedback from book club admins on what they think about the site, and if they have any ideas for how to improve it. We've created a structured feedback form, and we would be very grateful to get input from book club admins. It helps to inform the path that we are going.

The feedback form can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXl_-UCDy8lxtexUUN7IB7eJzTiRLX6cN3f88oqk73YmI8Lw/viewform).

## What's Next?

We want to understand the pain points of managing a book club first, anything that makes the book club admin's job easier. It could be reading in data from a spreadsheet, exporting data, figuring out the right onboarding flow.

In the future, we want to make it easier for book clubs to connect with the authors that they are reading. There are many talented authors out there that are looking for the readers. From the book club's perspective, we believe that, especially in this day and age, people want to read things that are real, from people who are real. There's so much machine generated garbage out there. Reading something that is clearly written by another human is refreshing. Connecting with other people is refreshing. This project intends to enable this kind of connection.

Your feedback helps us prioritize what to build next. Thank you for being part of the BookClurb community!
