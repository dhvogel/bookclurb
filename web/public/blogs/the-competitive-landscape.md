# The Competitive Landscape

There are a number of products out there that already help to facilitate book clubs. This post gives a quick summary of these products and adds more on why it makes sense to add to this landscape.

## Competitors

1. Bookclubs.com

[Bookclubs.com](https://bookclubs.com) is the most direct competitor, providing a set of tools to "Manage, start, or join a book club with ease." They also facilitate community through book clubs in enterprise and through their [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/bookclubshq) (~19K followers).

The problem is that bookclubs.com is not completely free-to-use. Features such as chat which is advertised on their home page ("Stay connected with chat"), is actually a premium feature that costs $65 per year per club. Same with a group photo album. A true freemium model would have these features be free to use up until a certain point.

In addition, bookclubs.com is closed source. All feature work goes through the bookclubs.com tech team, as opposed to facilitating contributions from the book club community. This is important because there are many different kinds of book clubs who may have different needs. For example a club devoted to 18th-century history may have different needs than a club that is a recovery support group. These may require different features that those clubs know best. With an open-source framework like BookClurb, these teams can just contribute these features back directly, without having to go through the bookclubs.com prioritization process.

2. Bookum

Bookum is a newer mobile-first book club app that I believe has done a great job adding a social element to its product, creating its own podcasts ("Authors Talk" and "Creators Talk"), and posting snipits of these to its instagram account. I feel that where Bookclubs.com is more moms-oriented, Bookum is more millenial- and gen-z-oriented, with this social element and a flashier UI, which includes a twitter-style feed for the personal home page.

However, Bookum, like bookclubs.com is also closed source and not true freemium as creating a club requires entering payment details. In general, I get the feeling that the focus is not as much on the club as it is on the individual. As of 11/3 the "Clubs" page only lists fifteen available clubs, and four of them have one member. The twitter feed and "top readers on Bookum" side panel are cool innovations, but they are focused on the individual, the feed shows the individual's social network and "top readers" shows individual accomplishments. It is just a different focus than both bookclubs.com and BookClurb.

3. Goodreads.com

Goodreads is Amazon-owned and the world's largest site for readers and book recommendations. It's mainly used for cataloguing one's personal reading collection and writing reviews for books. There are some social features, such as "Books My Friends Are Reading", but, like Bookum, the emphasis is really on individual book tracking and individual review contributions. 

It would be great, for example, to hook into the Goodreads system, but Goodreads famously [shut down its API](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95), making it more of a closed system.
